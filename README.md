#Modeling Cancer Metabolism Heterogeneity with MICOM

> You can download the modified version of micom that works with Recon2.2 from https://github.com/SantiagoMille/micom

##Data and code

The Python 3.7.9 notebooks used to generate each of the three reconstructions from the Recon2.2 model and transcription data can be found in the directory 'CORDA'.
Transcription data is located in the 'Trans. Data' directory.

The resulting SBML files containing the reconstructions are located in 'SBMLs' (current ones used for micom are: cobraA_Jan14_div50_NormalObj_no_PAREN.xml, cobraB_Jan8_NormalObj_no_PAREN.xml, cobraC_Jan8_NormalObj_no_PAREN.xml)

The python notebooks used to use micom can be found in directory micom
